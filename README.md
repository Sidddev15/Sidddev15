## 🚀 About Me

I’m a tech enthusiast with over **4 years of experience** developing **scalable, performant web applications**. My day-to-day stack is packed with **Angular**, **React**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and everything in between. I thrive on crafting smooth, seamless, and pixel-perfect user experiences.

I'm currently on a mission to **master backend development**, diving deeper into **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **system architecture**, and **low-level design (LLD)** — the realm where compilers, VMs, kernels, and scalable systems live. 🔍
